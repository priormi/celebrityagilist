I have a pair of 3 year old daughters at home.  

They.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___WHY___...

As cute (and sometimes annoying) as it is I understand, well, why.  They are doing this to ___BUILD___ &nbsp;their mental model.  As adults we, for the most part, have created our own mental models either through experience, reading, or have had our models created for us.  In business we create and document mental models for others in the form of "best practices" all through the misguided motivation of higher productivity by reducing waste or shortening the learning curve.  To the contrary, that very act takes away the organizations ability to ___LEARN HOW___ &nbsp;to learn.  If learning was just a means to an absolute end, then yes, shortening that learning curve could be advantageous.  However, as we work within these complex adaptive systems, learning is a ___CONSTANT___ &nbsp;where the end is never quite achieved or even fully realized.

I find that just asking the question of "why" challenges what we think we know about something.  Asking "why" is a way to engage our reflective thought and decision making system.  It allows us to consider context.  It allows us to break that downward sprial towards conformity and biased decision making because, as many of us have heard before, "we don't need to recreate the wheel".  Most of all, it allows us to encounter different situations and arrive at possibly different solutions.  In short, it allows us to learn.

Organizations can get so caught up in standardization of process or metrics that in the end they remove the very thing that will keep pushing them towards greatness; the opportunity for individuals to recognize and solve complex problems even when they ___THINK___&nbsp; there is a shortcut.  I'm not suggesting that these shortcuts don't have a place.  They tend to increase our decision velocity and keep things moving.

The trick is recognizing when to trust your shortcut and when to challenge it...
